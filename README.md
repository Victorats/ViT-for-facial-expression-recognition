# Vision Tranformer to facil expression recognition
You will find is the repository the implementation of a Vision Transformer based on the [AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS:TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16854) and [Facial Expression Recognition with Visual Transformers and Attentional Selective Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16854) papers. 
The ViT uses the idead of the transformer architecture to process image patches as sequences, enabling efficient and effective feature extraction for facial expression classification. This repository has the aim to reproduce the idea of this articles to label facial expression images with the correspondent expression potraid in the picture.
